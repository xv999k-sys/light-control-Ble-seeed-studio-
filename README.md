BLE LED Control with Seeed Studio nRF52840
Overview

This project allows you to control LEDS lights via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using the Seeed Studio nRF52840 board. It includes a web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to adjust the brightness of the LEDs in real-time.

This project is perfect for IoT lighting experiments, educational purposes, and quick prototypes.

Features

Wireless control of LEDs using BLE.

Adjust brightness levels from 0% to 100%.

Real-time control through a web interface.

Compatible with modern web browsers.

Easily extendable to additional colors or lighting effects.


Hardware Requirements

Seeed Studio nRF52840 development board.

 LEDs with current-limiting resistors.

USB cable for programming.

Optional: Breadboard and jumper wires for prototyping.


Note 🛑 : This version is programmed to handle only two LED.

Software Requirements

Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for firmware programming.

Modern web browser for interface (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Optional: nRF Connect app for testing BLE communication.


Notes

The range of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology may vary depending on obstacles and the surrounding environment.

The web interface requires a browser that supports the Web Bluetooth API.

The project can be easily extended for full control of RGB LEDs.

This version only works with Bluetooth BLE and does not work with Bluetooth Classic.
